**THIS PATCH IS A DRAFT AND IS NOT YET IN ITS FINAL FORM.  IT WILL
CHANGE, HOPEFULLY FOR THE BETTER.**

This patch is based on a some of what Cory Wong has discussed about
how he records in the studio with the addition of a cabinet.

Best played through a blue Strat.

Then shalt thou use pickup position four (neck + middle), no more, no
less.  Four shall be the position thou shalt use, and the number of
the position shall be four. Five shalt thou not use, neither use thou
three, excepting that thou then proceed to four. Five is tolerable,
four shall be ideal; three, two and one are right out.  Once the
position four, being the fourth position, be reached, then playest
thou thy funkiest riffs towards thy listeners who, being funky sorts
themselves, shall dig it.  (With [apologies to Monty
Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit_of_Caerbannog#Holy_Hand_Grenade_of_Antioch).)
