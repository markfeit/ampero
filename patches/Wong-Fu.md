**THIS PATCH IS A DRAFT AND IS NOT YET IN ITS FINAL FORM.  IT WILL
CHANGE, HOPEFULLY FOR THE BETTER.**

This patch is based on a some of what Cory Wong has discussed about
how he records in the studio with the addition of a cabinet.

 * **DLY** - Short time, medium feedback adds a non-Wongy but still
     interesting quality.
 
 * **RVB** - Defaults on; also non-Wongy, but the author likes it.

## Controls

## To Do

 * Get the compressor under control.
 * The fat part of the sound seems to be in the wrong part of the spectrum.
 * Investigate different cabinets; try something 4x10.
 * Decide what to do with FX3.
