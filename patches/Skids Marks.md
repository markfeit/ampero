# Skids Marks

Kick back with your vanilla wafers and some day-old banana puddin' for
a sound inspired by Rick Miller's more-recent on-stage rigs.

This patch was designed around a Stratocaster middle pickup for
_Banana Puddin'_ but works pretty well for most Southern Culture on
the Skids songs.  Switch to the bridge for more trebly tunes like
_King of the Mountain_ and _Liquored Up and Lacquered Down_.  The neck
pickup doesn't sound much like SCOTS at all and the blended positions
(bridge/middle, middle/neck) are... well... just _don't._

Of course, if you've got a ratty old Danelectro 3011 with a P-90 at
the bridge, and a good coating of chicken grease, use that.


## Controls

| Control | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| **CTRL** | Normal (Green) / Lead (Red) |
| **EXP1** | Tremolo Depth (See below)|
| **EXP2** | None |
| **Knob 1** | Normal Boost Treble |
| **Knob 2** | Lead Drive Tone |
| **Knob 3** | Patch Tempo |

### Notes

The tremolo depth increases as the pedal is pulled back and returns to
normal at the bottom of its travel so the patch is in its default
state when the pedal is disabled.

The lead setting switches the drive from clean to something noisier
(Boss SD-1) and drops the tremolo and delay.
