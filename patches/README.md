# Ampero Patches

This is a set of patches for the Ampero and Ampero One.

Each `.prst` file is accompanied by a `.md` file that can be clicked on to read the description.

To download a patch, click on its `.prst` file and then click the `Download` button on the right side of the page.

If you're looking for tweaked versions of the factory patches, those
can be found [here](../factory).

**NOTE:** Unless otherwise indicated, these patches were developed for
  Ampero firmware 3.7 and earlier.  The gain structure of the unit
  changed in 3.8, which means the patch level and cabinet volumes will
  need to be adjusted on units running that version.
