This is a straight-ahead Marshall JCM 800 patch inspired by the amp
settings in [this comparison
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAZFLYvKrIM).  The cabinet is
slightly different than the IR used in the video, opting for the
built-in UK Green cabinet with the Celestion Greenbacks over the
video's [OwnHammer 412MRCB
V30-EN1](https://www.ownhammer.com/store/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=215_216&products_id=449)
IR.
