|----------|--------|

Kick back with an eight-piece box for pair of sounds inspired by Rick
Miller's more-recent on-stage rigs.

This patch comes as a pair, one Fender-flavored (this patch) and one
Supro-flavored.

These patches were originally designed for playing _Banana Puddin'_
with a Stratocaster middle pickup but works pretty well for most
Southern Culture on the Skids songs.  Switch to the bridge for more
trebly tunes like _King of the Mountain_ or _Liquored Up and Lacquered
Down_.  The neck pickup doesn't sound much like SCOTS at all and the
blended positions (bridge/middle, middle/neck) are... well... just
_don't._

Of course, if you've got a ratty old Danelectro 3011 with a P-90 at
the bridge and a good coating of chicken grease, skip the Strat and
use that.


## Controls

| Control | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| **CTRL** | Normal (Green) / Lead (Red) |
| **EXP1** | Tremolo Depth (See below)|
| **EXP2** | None |
| **Knob 1** | Normal Boost Treble |
| **Knob 2** | Lead Drive Tone |
| **Knob 3** | Patch Tempo |

### Notes

The tremolo depth increases as the pedal is pulled back and returns to
normal at the bottom of its travel so the patch is in its default
state when the pedal is disabled.

The lead setting switches the drive from clean to something slightly
crunchier (Boss SD-1) and drops the tremolo and delay.
