It's Hard to Be in a Rude Mood when The House is Rockin' and you're
playing this patch with or without a Texas Flood of wah.  This patch's
Pride and Joy is the neck pickup on a Strat, but it wouldn't be Dirty
Pool to use the middle or both together.


**IMPORTANT NOTE:** A bug in version 3.7 of the Ampero firmware causes
the Cry Wah effect (FX2) to turn on when the patch is selected, which
isn't the desired behavior.  **Tap the CTRL button before playing to
turn it off.**  This problem has been reported to Hotone and the patch
will be corrected once they fix it.
