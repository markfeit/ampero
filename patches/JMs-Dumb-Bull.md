This patch is a revised version of _JM Dumblish Tone_, developed by
Min Park and originally
[posted](https://www.facebook.com/groups/HotoneAmperoUsers/permalink/903449460433280)
in the [Facebook Hotone Ampero Users
Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/HotoneAmperoUsers).  Min says
the sound was inspired by John Mayer's Dumble amplifier on
_[Belief](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiFh26fwdSI)_ and _[I Don't
Need No Doctor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4R-RrSbQ-Y)_ on _Live
in LA_.

Min's choices for drive, amp and cabinet make this patch work really
well on all five switch positions on a Strat, which is a rare thing.


Here's how this differs from the original, most of which are personal
preference:

 * Changed NR to Smart Gate.

 * Increased Green Drive volume to 50 so it stands out a little more
   for lead.

 * Cut amplifier gain back back to 24 avoid weird reaction to what
   was coming out of the Zen Garden.  (Interestingly, the Green Drive
   didn't have this problem.)

 * Put cabinet mic model on knob 3.  The other microphones add some
   interesting tonal options.

 * Set delay to eighth notes synced with the 100-ish BPM tempo on
   _Belief_.

 * Drop the delay in lead mode.

 * Switched reverb to Church.

 * Output level adjustments.
