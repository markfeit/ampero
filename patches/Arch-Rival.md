Strap on your archtop, roll back the tone control and play some jazz.

This patch harnesses some of the darkness and light breakup of a
Fender Bassman and puts it through a 15-inch bass cabinet to give it
a sound of an early-1950s amp.

The genesis of this patch was Hotone's _Archtop Clean_ (F06-3), but it
has evolved over time to have nothing in common with it.
