# Ampero Factory Patches Revisited

These are revisions of the factory patches that ship with the Ampero
and Ampero One that have been fine tuned, mostly for levels and noise
reduction.

The title of each revised patch has an asterisk (`*`) at the end to
indicate that it is not the original.

To download a patch, click on its `.prst` file and then click the
`Download` button on the right side of the page.

If you're looking for original patches, those can be found
[here](../patches).
